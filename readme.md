### About

Those challenges are a result of a Computer Security classes taken at University of Science and Technology in Krak√≥w, 
Poland. Their aim is to point out some of the most popular web application vulnerabilities and to test participants' 
knowledge about computer security and web application. Authors of the project:
- [Tomasz Wojakowski](https://github.com/Wojaqqq)
- [Bartosz Nieroda](https://github.com/qymaensheel)
- [Krzysztof Pala](https://github.com/pallovsky)

The numeration of those challenges starts at 11, because they're meant to be a continuation of challenges presented
on KIS AGH [Hackademic](https://vega.kis.agh.edu.pl/hackademic/) project.

### Challenges description

#### Challenge 11 
This is an easy challenge - password is already provided by your colleague - the author of this site. However, you know 
that he tends to do small mistakes on almost everything he does... Try to log in to his service.

#### Challenge 12
In this challenge you want to log to the website. You don't know much about this website, however the background
kinda looks like they may be pasting raw input values into their database queries...

#### Challenge 13
_"Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the ~~truth~~ password to this website."_
~_Buddha_

#### Challenge 14
Oh boy, this one may be tough. Just look at their technology stack, there does not seem to have any owasp
vulnerabilities... You have prepared some executable code (and you have it ready at `hackingsite.pl/myscript`) which 
could send you all the data from this website, however you'd have to force the application to execute it somehow...


#### Challenge 15
This site is a big one. It needs proper management. In order to manage this application there must be some special 
panel designed just for this. Try to find it.

### Solutions
